* * Removes double unary '-', '~', and 'not'\n     * * Eliminates addition/subtraction of 0 and multiplication/division/powers\n     *   by 1 or 0.\n     * * Converts addition of a negation into subtraction.\n     * * Eliminates logical operations with constant true or false leading\n     *   arguments.\n     * * Puts constants on the left of a product, if multiplication is\n     *
