changes are made.\r\n     * It's possible to pass a custom set of rules to the function as second\r\n     * argument. A rule can be specified as an object, string, or function:\r\n     *\r\n     *     const rules = [\r\n     *       { l: 'n1*n3 + n2*n3', r: '(n1+n2)*n3' },\r\n     *       'n1*n3 + n2*n3 -> (n1+n2)*n3',\r\n     *       function (node) {\r\n     *         // ... return a new node or return the node unchanged\r\n     *         return node\r\n     *       }\r\n     *     ]\r\n     *\r\n     * String and object rules consist of a left and right pattern. The left is\r\n     * used to match against the expression and the right determines what matches\r\n     * are replaced with. The main difference between a pattern and a normal\r\n     * expression is that variables starting with the following characters are\r\n     * interpreted as wildcards:\r\n     *\r\n     * - 'n' - Matches any node [Node]\r\n     * - 'c' - Matches a constant literal (5 or 3.2) [ConstantNode]\r\n     * - 'cl' - Matches a constant literal; same as c [ConstantNode]\r\n     * - 'cd' - Matches a decimal literal (5 or -3.2) [ConstantNode or unaryMinus wrapping a ConstantNode]\r\n     * - 'ce' - Matches a constant expression (-5 or √3) [Expressions consisting of only ConstantNodes, functions, and operators]\r\n     * - 'v' - Matches a variable; anything not matched by c (-5 or x) [Node that is not a ConstantNode]\r\n     * - 'vl' - Matches a variable literal (x or y) [SymbolNode]\r\n     * - 'vd' - Matches a non-decimal expression; anything not matched by cd (x or √3) [Node that is not a ConstantNode or unaryMinus that is wrapping a ConstantNode]\r\n     * - 've' - Matches a variable expression; anything not matched by ce (x or 2x) [Expressions that contain a SymbolNode or other non-constant term]\r\n     *\r\n     * The default list of rules is exposed on the function as `simplify.rules`\r\n     * and can be used as a basis to built a set of custom rules. Note that since\r\n     * the `simplifyCore` function is in the default list of rules, by default\r\n     * simplify will convert any function calls in the expression that have\r\n     * operator equivalents to their operator forms.\r\n     *\r\n     * To specify a rule as a string, separate the left and right pattern by '->'\r\n     * When specifying a rule as an object, the following keys are meaningful:\r\n     * - l - the left pattern\r\n     * - r - the right pattern\r\n     * - s - in lieu of l and r, the string form that is broken at -> to give them\r\n     * - repeat - whether to repeat this rule until the expression stabilizes\r\n     * - assuming - gives a context object, as in the 'context' option to\r\n     *     simplify. Every property in the context object must match the current\r\n     *     context in order, or else the rule will not be applied.\r\n     * - imposeContext - gives a context object, as in the 'context' option to\r\n     *     simplify. Any settings specified will override the incoming context\r\n     *     for all matches of this rule.\r\n     *\r\n     * For more details on the theory, see:\r\n     *\r\n     * - [Strategies for simplifying math expressions (Stackoverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7540227/strategies-for-simplifying-math-expressions)\r\n     * - [Symbolic computation - Simplification (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_computation#Simplification)\r\n     *\r\n     *  An optional `options` argument can be passed as last argument of `simplify`.\r\n     *  Currently available options (defaults in parentheses):\r\n     *  - `consoleDebug` (false): whether to write the expression being simplified\r\n     *    and any changes to it, along with the rule responsible, to console\r\n     *  - `context` (simplify.defaultContext): an object giving properties of\r\n     *    each operator, which determine what simplifications are allowed. The\r\n     *    currently meaningful properties are commutative, associative,\r\n     *    total (whether the operation is defined for all arguments), and\r\n     *    trivial (whether the operation applied to a single argument leaves\r\n     *    that argument unchanged). The default context is very permissive and\r\n     *    allows almost all simplifications. Only properties differing from\r\n     *    the default need to be specified; the default context is used as a\r\n     *    fallback. Additional contexts `simplify.realContext` and\r\n     *    `simplify.positiveContext` are supplied to cause simplify to perform\r\n     *    just simplifications guaranteed to preserve all values of the expression\r\n     *    assuming all variables and subexpressions are real numbers or\r\n     *    positive real numbers, respectively. (Note that these are in some cases\r\n     *    more restrictive than the default context; for example, the default\r\n     *    context will allow `x/x` to simplify to 1, whereas\r\n     *    `simplify.realContext` will not, as `0/0` is not equal to 1.)\r\n     *  - `exactFractions` (true): whether to try to convert all constants to\r\n     *    exact rational numbers.\r\n     *  - `fractionsLimit` (10000): when `exactFractions` is true, constants will\r\n     *    be expressed as fractions only when both numerator and denominator\r\n     *    are smaller than `fractionsLimit`.\r\n     *\r\n     * Syntax:\r\n     *\r\n     *     math.simplify(expr)\r\n     *     math.simplify(expr, rules)\r\n     *     math.simplify(expr, rules)\r\n     *     math.simplify(expr, rules, scope)\r\n     *     math.simplify(expr, rules, scope, options)\r\n     *     math.simplify(expr, scope)\r\n     *     math.simplify(expr, scope, options)\r\n     *\r\n     * Examples:\r\n     *\r\n     *     math.simplify('2 * 1 * x ^ (2 - 1)')      // Node \"2 * x\"\r\n     *     math.simplify('2 * 3 * x', {x: 4})        // Node \"24\"\r\n     *     const f = math.parse('2 * 1 * x ^ (2 - 1)')\r\n     *     math.simplify(f)                          // Node \"2 * x\"\r\n     *     math.simplify('0.4 * x', {}, {exactFractions: true})  // Node \"x * 2 / 5\"\r\n     *     math.simplify('0.4 * x', {}, {exactFractions: false}) // Node \"0.4 * x\"\r\n     *\r\n     * See also:\r\n     *\r\n     *     simplifyCore, derivative, evaluate, parse, rationalize, resolve\r\n     *\r\n     * @param {Node | string} expr\r\n     *            The expression to be simplified\r\n     * @param {SimplifyRule[]} [rules]\r\n     *            Optional list with custom rules\r\n     * @param {Object} [scope] Optional scope with variables\r\n     * @param {SimplifyOptions} [options] Optional configuration settings\r\n     * @return {Node} Returns the simplified form of `expr`\r\n     */\r\n    // Wrap in try-catch to handle case when both JS and TS versions are loaded\r\n    // in the same process (they share the same typed-function singleton)\r\n    try {\r\n      typed.addConversion({ from: 'Object', to: 'Map', convert: createMap })\r\n    } catch (e: any) {\r\n      // Ignore \"already exists\" error when conversion was registered by another instance\r\n      if (!e.message?.includes('already a conversion')) {\r\n        throw e\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    const simplify = typed('simplify', {\r\n      Node: _simplify,\r\n      'Node, Map': (expr: MathNode, scope: Map<string, any>) =>\r\n        _simplify(expr, false, scope),\r\n      'Node, Map, Object': (\r\n        expr: MathNode,\r\n        scope: Map<string, any>,\r\n        options: SimplifyOptions\r\n      ) => _simplify(expr, false, scope, options),\r\n      'Node, Array': _simplify,\r\n      'Node, Array, Map': _simplify,\r\n      'Node, Array, Map, Object': _simplify\r\n    })\r\n    typed.removeConversion({ from: 'Object', to: 'Map', convert: createMap })\r\n\r\n    simplify.defaultContext = defaultContext\r\n    simplify.realContext = realContext\r\n    simplify.positiveContext = positiveContext\r\n\r\n    function removeParens(node: MathNode): MathNode {\r\n      return node.transform(function (node: MathNode): MathNode {\r\n        return isParenthesisNode(node)\r\n          ? removeParens((node as ParenthesisNode).content)\r\n          : node\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // All constants that are allowed in rules\r\n    const SUPPORTED_CONSTANTS: Record<string, boolean> = {\r\n      true: true,\r\n      false: true,\r\n      e: true,\r\n      i: true,\r\n      Infinity: true,\r\n      LN2: true,\r\n      LN10: true,\r\n      LOG2E: true,\r\n      LOG10E: true,\r\n      NaN: true,\r\n      phi: true,\r\n      pi: true,\r\n      SQRT1_2: true,\r\n      SQRT2: true,\r\n      tau: true\r\n      // null: false,\r\n      // undefined: false,\r\n      // version: false,\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Array of strings, used to build the ruleSet.\r\n    // Each l (left side) and r (right side) are parsed by\r\n    // the expression parser into a node tree.\r\n    // Left hand sides are matched to subtrees within the\r\n    // expression to be parsed and replaced with the right\r\n    // hand side.\r\n    // TODO: Add support for constraints on constants (either in the form of a '=' expression or a callback [callback allows things like comparing symbols alphabetically])\r\n    // To evaluate lhs constants for rhs constants, use: { l: 'c1+c2', r: 'c3', evaluate: 'c3 = c1 + c2' }.
